# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: June 2, 2025
<!-- ##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

**Link to work:** [Calculator App](http://www.example.com) -->

#### Today's Progress
simple python cli calculator v1

#### Thoughts
It has been a long time since I coded sth completely without AI. I used some help from stackoverflow, though.

It took me more time than I have expected to complete v1, despite how limited features it has.
This is the very beginning of my 100 days of code challenge.
Don't be afraid of bugs. Find bugs wisely and avoid bugs in advance.

I adopted progressive development philosophy, only coding a simple v1, making it easy to add new features while keeping the core code.

### Day 1: June 3, 2025
#### Today's Progress
simple python cli calculator v2.1
now it can parse simple string like "2+3.0*-1"

#### Thoughts
second day without AI assistance in programming
stackoverflow can do the job
better with duckduckgo feature: automatically provide stackoverflow search result if query matches

I defined a stack with common data across different instances
remember to clear data in `__init__()`!

it took me some time to figure out how to handle `-` in input
since `-` could be operator and sign symbol before number

anyway, it's pycalc v2.1!
and a lot more to update

### Day 3: June 6, 2025
#### Today's Progress
learned about rich and argparse

#### Thoughts
I have to actually go to the documentation
since I made a rule to not to ask AI or let AI code
