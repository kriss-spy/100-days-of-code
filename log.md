# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: June 2, 2025
<!-- ##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

#### Today's Progress
simple python cli calculator v1

#### Thoughts
It has been a long time since I coded sth completely without AI. I used some help from stackoverflow, though.

It took me more time than I have expected to complete v1, despite how limited features it has.
This is the very beginning of my 100 days of code challenge.
Don't be afraid of bugs. Find bugs wisely and avoid bugs in advance.

I adopted progressive development philosophy, only coding a simple v1, making it easy to add new features while keeping the core code.

<!-- **Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
