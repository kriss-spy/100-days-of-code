# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: June 2, 2025
<!-- ##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

**Link to work:** [Calculator App](http://www.example.com) -->

#### Today's Progress

simple python cli calculator v1

#### Thoughts

It has been a long time since I coded sth completely without AI. I used some help from stackoverflow, though.

It took me more time than I have expected to complete v1, despite how limited features it has.
This is the very beginning of my 100 days of code challenge.
Don't be afraid of bugs. Find bugs wisely and avoid bugs in advance.

I adopted progressive development philosophy, only coding a simple v1, making it easy to add new features while keeping the core code.

### Day 1: June 3, 2025

#### Today's Progress

simple python cli calculator v2.1
now it can parse simple string like "2+3.0*-1"

#### Thoughts

second day without AI assistance in programming
stackoverflow can do the job
better with duckduckgo feature: automatically provide stackoverflow search result if query matches

I defined a stack with common data across different instances
remember to clear data in `__init__()`!

it took me some time to figure out how to handle `-` in input
since `-` could be operator and sign symbol before number

anyway, it's pycalc v2.1!
and a lot more to update

### Day 3: June 6, 2025

#### Today's Progress

learned about rich and argparse
v3.0 alpha with better input and output

#### Thoughts

I have to actually go to the documentation
since I made a rule to not to ask AI or let AI code

### Day 4: June 7, 2025

#### Today's Progress

pycalc now has complete arg parse feature! more user friendly!
compute inside or externally

#### Thoughts

I carefully checked argparse documentation to figure out how to use add_argument()
good experience
I am becoming less dependent on AI!

### Day 5: June 8, 2025

#### Today's Progress

TOP assginment.
Added css to html-based recipe website
Actually coding css withoug any AI!
Previous pycalc (cli calculator), which is developed without AI, is a good start.
From now on I will focus on web dev.

#### Thoughts

It's a good practice to understand what you have learned in CSS tutorials.
From a developer perspective, you start to think what style you should use.

### Day 6: June 10, 2025

#### Today's Progress

TOP assignment.

flex practice

#### Thoughts

I didn't realize that flex is not a easy concept until I met the exercises
understanding the concept is one thing, applying what you have learned in practice is another

hopefully I can master it in further coding

### Day 7: June 11, 2025

#### Today's Progress

TOP css part project-landing-page
refer to full-design and color-and-styles
built a webpage by hand, without AI!

#### Thoughts

this is my first time to build sth like an actual website without AI coding
although it's simple, no responsive design, not pretty
it's a remarkable step
keep going

#### Link to work

### Day 9: 2025-06-14

### Day 11: 2025-06-17

#### Today's Progress

important doc and structure change for shopguard-chatbot

### Day 12: 2025-06-19

#### Today's Progress

did more js exercise

working on the frontend work of the project

finished basic page design

#### Thoughts

after I learned the very basics of web dev, HTML, CSS, JS

I can tell that it's different when I look at AI generated website again

now I am able to describe the bug in details, I can have deeper conversation with AI, on how the website look, what is my desired appearance

it's kind of weird that I have to learn before talk to coding AI.
maybe someday AI will be smart enough to understand what a normal people without web dev knowledge is trying to convey

### Day 13: 2025-06-25

### Day 14: 2025-06-27

#### Today's Progress

TOP project calculator
final project of Foundations

simple web page calculator

#### Thoughts

it turned out to be not very easy to design the layout of calculator

and the main calculation logic, implemented by js, took me some time

devtools isn't good enough for debugging js, so I used vscode

approaching the desert described in TOP, I guess :(

well, TOP foundations is reaching the end very soon

still a long way to go
